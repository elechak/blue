BUGS
---------
* string[5] segfaults
* threads in win32 are slow


POTENTIAL BUGS
------------------------
* thread and mutex types should be structure - proprietary handles make me nervous
* sendmessage/CREATE in graphics plugins needs to be worked on int linux and win32
* protect arg access with mutex 
* array.sort needs to be more resiliant
* look at trap compilation 



STYLE
----------



ENHANCEMENTS / OPTIMIZATIONS
------------------------------
* getattr # opcode: pass a string argument rather than pop off the stack
* window and linux{ ... } blocks
* 3.4532i  for imaginary numbers
* xml.getAttrib()
* add compiled code tests
* value used before initialized error should be compile time error


FUTURE
----------------
* easier to build
    - blue main should be a library
* add   " f = async { ... }" to standard syntax
* get rid of PUSH_NULL POP
* register functions to run when switching thread modes
* += type operators
* .= method()  operator
